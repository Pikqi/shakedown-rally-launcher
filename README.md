# Shakedown Rally Launcher

Just a small car and map loader for Shakedown since it doesn't have in-game switching of cars and maps yet.

Uses Sokol Zig and Dear ImGui. Based on the [sokol imgui sample](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-zig-imgui-sample) repo.

To build just run `zig build run`. Built with zig 0.13.0
